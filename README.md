# UCB_Lesson_3_Election_Analysis
My first python analysis!!

### Project Overview
We were requested by a Colorado (herein, CO) Board of Elections employee to execute an election audit of a recent local congressional election. The audit focused on the following items:
1. Calcuate the total number of votes cast
2. Get a complete list of the candidates that received votes
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won
5. Determine the winner of the election (based on popular vote)

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python

## Summary
The analysis of the election showed that there were 369,711 votes cast in the election. A total of three candidates received votes. The candidates that received votes were:
- Charles Casper Stockham (herein, Mr. Stockham)
- Diana DeGette (herein, Ms. DeGette)
- Raymon Anthony Doane (herein, Mr. Doane)

The results for each candidate are outlined below.
- Mr. Stockham received 23.0% of total votes for 85,213 votes cast for him
- Ms. DeGette receive 73.8% of total votes for 272,892 votes cast for her
- Mr. Doane received 3.1% of total votes for 11,606 votes cast for him

Based on the analysis performed, Ms. DeGette appears to be the winner of the election, having received the majority (73.8%) of all votes. 

## Challenge Overview
After completing the initial assessment, for the challenge, we are helping the same CO Board of Elections employee confirm voter turnout for each county that voted in this congressional district. To perform the analysis, the same resources were used. 

## Challenge Summary
To perform the analysis, we were required to pull in county level information (which previously was excluded from the analysis). Three counties were represented in the data. The counties represented are: Jefferson, Denver, and Arapahoe.

The county with the largest turnout (i.e., the most votes cast for a candidate) was Denver. Denver had 82.8% of total votes or 306,055 ballots cast in the election. Jefferson had the second highest turnout with 10.5% of total votes or 38,855 ballots cast. Arapahoe had the smallest turnout of the three counties with 6.7% of total votes or 24,801 ballots cast.
