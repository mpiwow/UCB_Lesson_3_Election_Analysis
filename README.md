My first python analysis!!

### Project Overview
We were requested by a CO Board of Elections employee to execute an election audit of a recent local congressional election. The audit focused on the following items:
1. Calcuate the total number of votes cast
2. Get a complete list of the candidates that received votes
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won
5. Determine the winner of the election (based on popular vote)
